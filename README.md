# Gaussian Processes from zero to hero



A 7-step plan from learn Gaussian Processes from zero to hero. There are steps for consume information [I] and generate outputs [O].

1. [I] Read Kevin Murphy chapter 17.
2. [I] Watch *[The Art of Gaussian Processes: Classical and Contemporary](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/tutorial/21890)* tutorial.
3. [O] Using (1) and (2) implement a mini-project using GP and write a blog post.
4. [I] Read _[Kernels for Vector-Valued Functions: a Review](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/114503/1/1106.6251v2.pdf)_, specially from section 3.3.
5. [I] Read _[Spectral Mixture Kernels for Multi-Output Gaussian Processes](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/333cb763facc6ce398ff83845f224d62-Abstract.html)_ with the orignal model from MOGPTK
6. [I] Read _[MOGPTK: the multi-output Gaussian process toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03471)_.
7. [O] Using the MOGPTK create a mini-project and write a blog post.
